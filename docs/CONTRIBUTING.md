## Pull Request checklist

Pull Request (<abbr title="Pull Request">PR</abbr>) process and proceedures.

1. Ensure any `install` or `build` dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the `README.md` with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the `README.md` to the new version that this <abbr title="Pull Request">PR</abbr> would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](https://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the <abbr title="Pull Request">PR</abbr> in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
